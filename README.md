# Elecctro React Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to implement a simple To-Do list application with CRUD functionality. 
I will attempt a TDD approach.

## Setup
- Create a new project called `elecctro` using the `create-react-app` command.
- I installed `eslint` to enforce the AirBnB code style.
- I will use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to style the application.
- There are no additional dependencies required for this challenge.

## Bonus Setup (If there is available time)
- The animation library [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion/). It is a heavy dependency,
but will allow me to create a more interactive experience with minimal effort.
- The [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) library will allow me to create a more dynamic experience.
- Finally, I will replace the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) with the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/api/store) library for a more scalable application.

# The To-Do List
I will start by creating the individual components of the application. I will then style the application with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and then implement the CRUD logic via [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
